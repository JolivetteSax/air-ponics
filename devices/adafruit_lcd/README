prereq:
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

ubuntu puts this device on /dev/ttyACM0 by default. If it works your device
subsystem will send a bunch of AT control commands when it connects (and they
just get passed right along the I2C bus straight to the text display

example:

~/air-ponics/devices/adafruit_lcd$ ./waitStart.sh 
waiting for device file /dev/ttyACM0
Device connected.
Permissions established.
Checking device ready to receieve...
Screen cleared.
done.
~/air-ponics/devices/adafruit_lcd$

This will flash the word "Ready" in white on the display and then leave the 
current time/date.
